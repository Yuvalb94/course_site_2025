# Hackathon Guidelines

- The hackathon will take place from the morning of Sunday, July 2th, until Monday night.
- There will be a kick-off meeting Sunday morning at 9:00.
- Groups working on a particular dataset will be granted access to the data by the day before the hackathon, and will meet with their assigned mentor either on the day before or the morning of the hackathon, dependeing on the mentors' and group members' availability.
- Each group will schedule a presentation with Gal and Zvi on Tuesday, July 4th, to showcase their work.
- The projects are expected to be the result of two days' work, and will be graded accordingly. The rationale for scheduling the presentations on Tuesday is to give you the full two days for coding and not force you to have to prepare the presentation during the weekend.
- Grading:
  - Code quality (50%)
    - Design patterns and coding paradigms
    - PEP8
    - Integration of the scientific Python stack
    - Tests
    - Git
    - Docstrings
    - Documentation (informative README or more)
    - Packaging and PyPI
  - Team collaboration (30%)
  - Does it work? (20%)
