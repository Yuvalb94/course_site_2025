# Hackathon Guidelines

- The hackathon will take place from the morning of Monday, August 19th, until Tuesday night of August 20th.
- Please follow [this link](https://forms.gle/zAPZNUSrijxtdY8a8) to submit your preferences for the project you'll work on.
- There will be a kick-off gathering Monday morning at 9:00 at [HaMiflat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GG4KSV4PsXCeSeEt6).
- HaMiflat is located on floor -1 of the Student Association building (Mitchell).
- Groups working on a particular dataset will be granted access to the data by the day before the hackathon, and will meet with their assigned mentor either on the day before or the morning of the hackathon, depending on the mentors' and group members' availability.
- Each group will schedule a presentation with Gal after Wednesday, August 21st, to showcase their work.
- The projects are expected to be the result of two days' work, and will be graded accordingly. The rationale for scheduling the presentations after Wednesday is to give you the full two days for coding and not force you to have to prepare the presentation during this time.
- Grading:
  - Code quality (50%)
    - Design patterns and coding paradigms
    - PEP8
    - Integration of the scientific Python stack
    - Tests
    - Git
    - Docstrings
    - Documentation (informative README or more)
    - Packaging and PyPI
